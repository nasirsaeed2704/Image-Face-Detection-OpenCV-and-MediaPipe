# Image-Face-Detection-OpenCV-and-MediaPipe
This project showcases a robust face detection system that processes images to identify and highlight faces by drawing bounding boxes around them. By combining the power of OpenCV and MediaPipe's advanced face detection module, this implementation delivers accurate results with minimal effort.
